# Resort-Management-System

The Resort Management System project aims to revolutionize the way resorts operate by providing a comprehensive online platform for managing reservations, accommodations, and facilities. This system is designed to streamline the booking process for tourists, offering detailed information about room availability, types of accommodations, and unique features of each resort. By centralizing these services online, the system significantly reduces the need for manual record-keeping and phone-based inquiries, thereby enhancing the efficiency and customer experience for both resorts and their visitors.
The project is implemented using HTML, CSS for web technologies, and MySQL as the backend database. It consists of five key modules: Accommodation Information, Units Information, Bookings Information, Guests Information, and Facilities Information. Each module serves a specific purpose, from providing detailed information about accommodations and their costs to facilitating the booking process and managing guest information.
